<h2>The true speed of a car</h2>

<p>The speed of the car Mario is 6 km / h. And that's yours?</p>

<p>Mario uses his own car to get to work.</p>

<p>Since leaving the house when it comes to the workplace pass  minutes [1] , and the ride is  kilometers.</p>

<p>We can calculate the speed of door-to-door [2] in a very simple way, with the classic space / time: it is 19 km / h. Keep in mind that you are traveling by bicycle without difficulty at 20 km / h [3].</p>

<p>For a more significant, however, we must also consider the cost of the car. In one year, Mario spends:</p>

<ul>
	<li>automobile liability insurance: € 
	<li>ownership tax: € 
	<li>expenses for routine maintenance: € 
	<li>other expenses (tolls, parking, etc..): € 
</ul>

<p>The car was purchased for €  Mario and expects to be able to use  years. It is therefore € 1,125 per year.</p>

<p>The route will route  times a day, for  days per week, for  weeks in a year. Paths are then 3680 km per year [4] .</p>

<p>Given that one liter of fuel costs €  , And that his car is  km per liter, Mario spends € 396 each year in fuel. But the real costs [5] of car use are € 2,521.</p>

<p>What does have costs with the speed? To earn € 2521, Mario has to work for 403 hours (with his monthly salary of €  , For  hours of work).</p>

<p>Within a year, how much is the time that Mario takes to travel by car we have calculated the 3680 km? Not only 192 hours spent driving (or walking), but also worked to afford the use of the car. In total, it is therefore 595 hours.</p>

<p>Then we calculate the generalized velocity [6] , which also takes account of this aspect: 3680 km / h 595, ie 6 km / h. It is a speed comparable to that of a person walking.</p>
