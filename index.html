			<h1>The true speed of a car</h1>
			<div id="part_01" class="card">
				<h2>Startpage</h2>
				<p>The speed of Mario's car is [!OUT!] km/h. And what is your car's?</p>
				<button>Caluclate your own speed</button>
			</div>
			
			<div id="part_02" class="card">
				<h2>Options</h2>
				<p>Mario uses his own car to get to work.</p>

				<h3>Way</h3>
				
				<p>Between leaving home and reaching his workplace [?IN?] minutes pass. The ride is [?IN?] kilometers. [*]</p>
				
				<p>He will drive the route [?IN?] times a day, for [?IN?] days per week, for [?IN?] weeks in a year.</p>
				
				<h3>Expenses</h3>

				<p>For a more significant computation, however, we must also consider the cost of the car. In one year Mario spends:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>car insurance: &euro; [?IN?]
					<li>ownership tax: &euro; [?IN?]
					<li>expenses for maintenance: &euro; [?IN?]
					<li>other expenses (tolls, parking, etc..): &euro; [?IN?]
				</ul>

				<p>The car was purchased for &euro; [?IN?]. Mario expects to be able to use it [?IN?] years.</p>
				
				<p>One liter of fuel costs &euro; [?IN?], and his car consumes [?IN?] liter per km</p>
				
				<h3>Time</h3>
				
				<p>Mario has a monthly salary of &euro; [?IN?], for [?IN?] hours of work.</p>

				
				
				
			</div>

			<div id="part_03" class="card">
				<h2>Calculation</h2>
				<h3>Way</h3>
				
				<p>The total path of his way to the workplace is [!OUT!] km per year [*].</p>
				
				<p>We can calculate the <em>door-to-door</em> speed of in a very simple way, with the classic <em>space / time</em> formula: it is [!OUT!] km/h. [*]</p>
				
				<h3>Expenses</h3>
				
				<p>Mario spends &euro; [!OUT!] per year for his car.</p>
				
				<p>He also spends &euro; [!OUT!] each year in fuel. But the real costs [*] of car use are &euro; [!OUT!].</p>
				
				<h3>Time</h3>

				<p>What do costs have to do with the speed? To earn &euro; [!OUT!], Mario has to work for [!OUT!] hours.</p>
				
				<p>Within a year, how much time does Mario spend to travel by car for his [!OUT!] km?. We have to take into consideration not only the [!OUT!] hours he spends on driving (or walking), but also the time he worked to afford the car. In total, it is therefore [!OUT!] hours.</p>

				<h2>Comparison</h2>
			
				<dl>
					<dt>Car:</dt>
					<dd>The generalized velocity is: [!OUT!] km/h [!OUT!], ie. [!OUT!] km/h. [*]</dd>
				
					<dt>Walking:</dt>
					<dd>A person walking has a speed of 6 km/h.</dd>
				
					<dt>Cycling:</dt>
					<dd>Keep in mind that you can easily travel by bicycle at 20 km/h. [*])</dd>
