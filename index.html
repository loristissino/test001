			<h1>The true speed of a car</h1>

				<h2>Startpage</h2>
				<p>The speed of <a href="./index.html#details">Mario</a> is [! <code>OUT</code> !] km/h. And what is yours ?</p>
				<button onclick="location.href='./index.html#input'">Calculate your own speed</button>

			<div id="input" class="card">
				<h2>Input</h2>
				<p>You use your [? <code>IN</code> ?]  to get to work.</p>
				
        		<p class="new">(new: the vehicle could be chosen from a fixed list [car, motorcycle, bicycle] - loris)</p>
        		<p class="note">(note: the name of the vehicle's owner is only important when saving, eg. under caluclation/details - christopher)</p>

				<h3>Way</h3>
				
				<p>Between leaving home and reaching the workplace [? <code>IN</code> ?] minutes pass. The ride is [? <code>IN</code> ?] kilometers. [*]</p>
				
				<h3>Expenses</h3>

				<p>For a more significant computation, however, we must also consider the cost of the car. In one year you spend:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>car insurance: &euro; [? <code>IN</code> ?]
					<li>ownership tax: &euro; [? <code>IN</code> ?]
					<li>expenses for maintenance: &euro; [? <code>IN</code> ?]
					<li>other expenses (tolls, parking, etc..): &euro; [? <code>IN</code> ?]
				</ul>

				<p>The car was purchased for &euro; [? <code>IN</code> ?]. You expect to be able to use it [? <code>IN</code> ?] years.</p>
				
				<p class="proposal">(proposal: The car is used for [? <code>IN</code> ?] % private purposes.)</p>
				<p class="note">(note: How would we take it in consideration? And what do you mean by "private purposes"? - loris)</p>
				<p class="proposal"> meaning, that you don't use your car only to get to work and this should be taken into account to the expenses - christopher)</p>
				
				<p>One liter of fuel costs &euro; [? <code>IN</code> ?], and your car consumes [? <code>IN</code> ?] liter per km</p>

				<p class="note">(note: We have to think about how to deal with different currencies, fuel prices, etc - loris)</p>
				
				<p class="proposal">(proposal: Maybe first we should stick to the euro (sic!), but later it, should be no problem to add a currency parameter)</p>
				
				<h3>Time</h3>
				
				<p>You will drive the route to work [? <code>IN</code> ?] times a day</p>
				
				<p>You work [? <code>IN</code> ?] a day, for [? <code>IN</code> ?] days per week and [? <code>IN</code> ?] weeks in a year.</p>
				
				<p>You have a monthly salary of &euro; [? <code>OUT</code> ?]<del>, for [? <code>IN</code> ?] hours of work</del>.</p>

			<p class="note">(note: hours of work is also in the calculation below - christopher)</p>

			<p class="note">(note: yes, but there it is an output - loris)</p>
			
			<p class="proposal">(proposal: yes, but it doesn't need to be repeated here - christopher)</p>

					<p class="note">(note: change it to public transport or add public transport? - loris)</p>

				<h2>Details (Input + Calculation)</h2>
				
				<p class="proposal">(repeat Input?)</p>
				
				<h3>Way</h3>
				
				<p>The total path of the way to the workplace is [! <code>OUT</code> !] km per year [*].</p>
				
				<p><del>We can calculate the <em>door-to-door</em> speed of in a very simple way, with the classic <em>space / time</em> formula: it is [! <code>OUT</code> !] km/h. [*]</del></p>
				<p class="note">(note: why do we need the door-to-door-speed? - christopher)</p>
        
        <p class="note">(note: in my original version, the idea was to show that the speed is much lower than the one seen on one's speedometer, even if you don't consider the costs involved; you have to take a long way to bypass the city center, for instance, or you park your car quite far from your destination - loris)</p>
        
        		<p class="proposal">(proposal: yes, but that is all include in the way input: "between home and work" - christopher)</p>
        
				<h3>Expenses</h3>
				
				<p>You have to spend &euro; [! <code>OUT</code> !] per year for a vehicle.</p>
				
				<p>You also have to spend &euro; [! <code>OUT</code> !] each year for fuel. But the real costs [*] are &euro; [! <code>OUT</code> !].</p>
				
				<h3>Time</h3>

				<p>What do costs have to do with the speed?</p>
				
				<p>Within a year, how much time do you spend to travel?. We have to take into consideration not only the [! <code>OUT</code> !] hours on driving, but also the time you have to work to afford the vehicle - you have to work for [! <code>OUT</code> !] hours.</p>
				
				<p>In total, it is therefore [! <code>OUT</code> !] hours.</p>
				
				<h3>Summary</h3>
				
				<p class="proposal"><strong>The generalized velocity is: [! <code>OUT</code> !] km / [! <code>OUT</code> !] h, ie. [! <code>OUT</code> !] km/h</strong></p>
