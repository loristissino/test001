<h2>The true speed of a car</h2>

<p>Mario's car speed is [!OUT!] km / h. What is your car's?
<!-- shouldn't this be towards the end?, christopher. -->
</p>

<p>Mario uses his own car to get to work.</p>

<p>Between leaving home and reaching his workplace [?IN?] minutes pass. The ride is [?IN?] kilometers. [*]</p>

<p>We can calculate the <em>door-to-door</em> speed of in a very simple way, with the classic <em>space / time</em> formula: it is [!OUT!] km/h. [*]</p>

<p>(Keep in mind that you can easily travel by bicycle at 20 km/h. [*])</p>

<p>For a more significant computation, however, we must also consider the cost of the car. In one year Mario spends:</p>

<ul>
	<li>car insurance: &euro; [?IN?]
	<li>ownership tax: &euro; [?IN?]
	<li>expenses for maintenance: &euro; [?IN?]
	<li>other expenses (tolls, parking, etc..): &euro; [?IN?]
</ul>

<p>The car was purchased for &euro; [?IN?]. Mario expects to be able to use it [?IN?] years. It is therefore &euro; [!OUT!] per year.</p>

<p>He will drive the route [?IN?] times a day, for [?IN?] days per week, for [?IN?] weeks in a year. The total path is then [!OUT!] km per year [*].</p>

<p>Given that one liter of fuel costs &euro; [?IN?], and that his car consumes [?IN?] liters per km, Mario spends &euro; [!OUT!]  each year in fuel. But the real costs [*] of car use are &euro; [!OUT!].</p>

<p>What do costs have to do with the speed? To earn &euro; [!OUT!], Mario has to work for [!OUT!] hours (with his monthly salary of &euro; [?input?], for [?IN?] hours of work).</p>

<p>Within a year, how much time does Mario spend to travel by car for his [!OUT!] km?. We have to take into consideration not only the [!OUT!] hours he spends on driving (or walking), but also the time he worked to afford the car. In total, it is therefore [!OUT!] hours.</p>

<p>Then we calculate the generalized velocity, which also takes account of this aspect: [!OUT!] km/h [!OUT!], ie. [!OUT!] km/h. [*]</p>
<p><strong>It is a speed comparable to that of a person walking.</strong></p>
